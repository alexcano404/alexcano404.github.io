Theorem (Continuous functional calculus)
Let $a$ be a [[normal element]] in a [[unital]] [[C-star-Algebra]] $A$ , suppose that $z:\sigma(a)\hookrightarrow\mathbb{C}$ is the natural inclusion map of the [[spectrum]] of $a$ into the complex plane. Then there exists a unique unital $*$-homomorphism $\varphi:C(\sigma(a))\to A$ such that $\varphi(z)=a$
More is true; $\varphi$ is an isometric and $im(\varphi)$ is the $C^{*}$-algebra generated by $1$ and $a$.

_Proof:_
1. _Invoke the Gelfand representation_.
	Denote by $B$ the abelian $C^{*}$-algebra generated by $1$ and $a$
	Let   $\psi:B\to C(\Omega(B))$ be the Gelfand representation.
	 (See [[2.1.10 Theorem (Gelfand)]])
2. _Properties of the Gelfand representation_ 
	By [[2.1.10 Theorem (Gelfand)]] $\psi$ is a $*$-isomorphism.
3. _Transpose map_ 
	Since the map $\hat{a}:\Omega(B)\to\sigma(a)$ is a [[homeomorphism]], we know that the transpose mapping induced by precomposing with  $\hat{a}$ , namely $\hat{a}^{t}:C(\Omega(B))\to C(\sigma(a))$ is a $*$-isomorphism.
4. _Define the mapping from continuous functions on spectra to A_
	Let $\varphi: C(\sigma(a))\to A$ be defined as the composition 
	$\psi^{-1}\hat{a}^{t}(f)=\psi^{-1}(f\circ\hat{a})=\psi^{-1}(f\circ\hat{a})$
	 So it takes a continuous function $f$ on the spectrum of $a$, it precomposes $f$ with $\hat{a}$, this changes the domain to be the character space of $B=C^{*}(1,a)$ then $\psi^{-1}$ takes $f\circ\hat{a}\in C(\Omega(B))$ and maps it to $B\subset A$. So altogether we get a map from continuous functions on the character space of $B$ into $A$.
5. _Evaluation of the identity map on the character space spectra(a)_
	Now we consider the evaluation $\varphi(z)=\psi^{-1}(\hat{a}^t(z))=\psi^{-1}(z(\hat{a}))=\psi^{-1}(\hat{a})=a$
	[Obviously] $\varphi$ is [[unital]].
6. _Check that phi is unital_
	$\varphi(1)=\psi^{-1}(1\circ\hat{a})=\psi^{-1}(1)$ 
	Now since $\psi$ which is the [[Gelfand representation]] is a $*$-isomorphism, then the inverse is, and it must be unital.
7. _Invoke Stone-Weierstrass Theorem_
	By the [[Stone-Weierstrass]] theorem, we know that $C(\sigma(a))$ is generated by $1$ and $z$. This required the spectrum of $a$ to be compact. We had to prove that the image of $\varphi$ was indeed the $C^{*}$-algebra generated by $1$ and $a$
8. _Reflect_
	We constructed an injective $*$-homomorphism from the continuous functions on $\sigma(a)$ to the $C^{*}$-algebra $A$ which contained $a$.
	We showed that it mapped the unity to the unity, and the generator $z$ to $a$. By [[Stone-Weierstrass]] we have that the image of this map must be the $C^{*}$-algebra generated by $1$ and $a$. 


	The uniqueness is strange though, will require more pondering
$\mathcal{QED}$

<h2 id="welcome-">Welcome!</h2>
<hr>
<p>The aim of this student seminar is to ignite interest in the fascinating field of operator algebras. We plan to introduce participants to a diverse range of topics within C*-algebra and von Neumann algebra theory. Our goal is to foster a vibrant community where graduate students from various disciplines can attend, learn, and engage with significant results, concepts, and tools that intersect with their own research and coursework.</p>
<p>Topics include but are not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Operator K-theory</li>
<li>Index Theory</li>
<li>Topological Dynamics</li>
<li>C*-algebra theory</li>
<li>von Neumann algebra theory</li>
<li>Noncommutative geometry and topology</li>
</ul>

<p>The seminar is on <strong>Mondays at 4:30</strong>, and if you would like to give at talk, please email cano13 at purdue dot edu.</p>
<hr>
<p>The schedule for fall 2024 is below:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>August 29</strong>, Introductions and interests, location: MATH </p>
<ul>
<li>Speakers: <em>Alejandro Cano, Hao Wan, Chrisil Ouseph</em></li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><p><strong>September 9</strong>, Direct integral decomposition of von Neumann algebras, location: SCHM 314</p>
<li><em>Abstract:</em> In this survey talk, we will explore the direct integral of von Neumann algebras and its applications to addressing problems related to the rigidity of group von Neumann algebras with diffuse center.</li>
<ul>  
<li>Speaker: <em>Adriana Fernández Quero</em>, University of Iowa</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>September 16</strong>, Group C*-Algebras, the Fourier transform and locally compact groups.</p>
</li>
<li><p><em>Abstract</em>: We define two types of C*-Algebras which we can associate to a large class of groups, and study the properties which each object can reflect from the other. In doing so, we state a number of theorems which tie the Fourier transform  to a dual object of the group C*-Algebra we construct. The tools along the way will include representation theory, abstract integration theory, and functional analysis. </p>
<ul>
<li>Speaker: <em>Alejandro Cano</em>, Purdue University</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<ul>
<li><p><strong>September 23</strong>, Hilbert Hotels on Hilbert Spaces</p>
</li>
<li><p><em>Abstract</em>:  The talk will shine a light on the rich and underrated history of the interaction between set theory and operator algebras. We will warm up with a brisk jog through the necessary prerequisites in logic. A surprising survey of several results will follow, starting with an independence result in functional analysis. The remainder of the talk will be a showcase of some of the unexpected consequences in operator algebras of the Continuum Hypothesis and other independent axioms: a representation theorem for the double dual of C[0,1], weak expectations on von Neumann algebras, ultrapowers, and automorphisms on the Caulkin Algebra.
 </p>
<ul>
<li>Speaker: <em>Chrisil Ouseph</em>, Purdue University</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>



<ul>
<li><p><strong>September 30</strong>, Introduction to finite free probability
</p>
</li>
<li><p><em>Abstract</em>:  Finite free additive and multiplicative convolutions are binary operations of polynomials that behave well with respect to the roots. These operations have gained interest in recent years due to its interpretation as expected characteristic polynomials of random matrix operations and their connection to free probability, geometry of polynomials, representation theory and combinatorics. We will study in detail the basic properties of these convolutions of polynomials, survey the results in the area, and mention some interesting open problems.

<li>Speaker: <em>Daniel Perales</em>, Texas A&M</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>



<ul>
<li><p><strong>September 21</strong>, The K-theoretic Atiyah-Singer Index Theorem
</p>
</li>
<li><p><em>Abstract</em>: Index theorems relate global analytic information of a manifold (the number of solutions to an elliptic PDE on the manifold) to a sum of topological invariants over the manifold. Index theorems relate topology and analysis with applications ranging from mathematical physics to operator algebras. I will state and unpack the Atiyah-Singer Index theorem in the language of K-theory, which provides the most "big picture" overview of the result.

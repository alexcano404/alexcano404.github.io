<h2 id="welcome-">Welcome!</h2>
<hr>
<p>The aim of this student seminar is to ignite interest in the fascinating field of operator algebras. We plan to introduce participants to a diverse range of topics within C*-algebra and von Neumann algebra theory. Our goal is to foster a vibrant community where graduate students from various disciplines can attend, learn, and engage with significant results, concepts, and tools that intersect with their own research and coursework.</p>
<p>Topics include but are not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Operator K-theory</li>
<li>Index Theory</li>
<li>Topological Dynamics</li>
<li>C*-algebra theory</li>
<li>von Neumann algebra theory</li>
<li>Noncommutative geometry and topology</li>
</ul>
<p>We plan to have the seminar on <strong>Mondays</strong>, and if you would like to give at talk, please email cano13 at purdue dot edu.</p>

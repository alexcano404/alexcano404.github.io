# 2.1.13 Theorem (Continuous functional calculus)
Let \(a\) be a [[normal element]] in a [[unital]] [[C-star-Algebra]] \(A\), suppose that \(z:\sigma(a)\hookrightarrow\mathbb{C}\) is the natural inclusion map of the [[spectrum]] of \(a\) into the complex plane. Then there exists a unique unital \( * \)-homomorphism \(\varphi:C(\sigma(a))\to A\) such that \(\varphi(z)=a\).
More is true; \(\varphi\) is an isometric and \(im(\varphi)\) is the \(C^{*}\)-algebra generated by \(1\) and \(a\).

_Proof:_
1. _Invoke the Gelfand representation_.
    Denote by \(B\) the abelian \(C^{*}\)-algebra generated by \(1\) and \(a\)
    Let   \(\psi:B\to C(\Omega(B))\) be the Gelfand representation.
     (See [[2.1.10 Theorem (Gelfand)]])
2. _Properties of the Gelfand representation_ 
    By [[2.1.10 Theorem (Gelfand)]] \(\psi\) is a \( * \)-isomorphism.
3. _Transpose map_ 
    Since the map \(\hat{a}:\Omega(B)\to\sigma(a)\) is a [[homeomorphism]], we know that the transpose mapping induced by precomposing with  \(\hat{a}\) , namely \(\hat{a}^{t}:C(\Omega(B))\to C(\sigma(a))\) is a \( * \)-isomorphism.
4. _Define the mapping from continuous functions on spectra to \(A\)_ 
    Let \(\varphi: C(\sigma(a))\to A\) be defined as the composition 
    \(\psi^{-1}\hat{a}^{t}(f)=\psi^{-1}(f\circ\hat{a})=\psi^{-1}(f\circ\hat{a})\)
     So it takes a continuous function \(f\) on the spectrum of \(a\), it precomposes \(f\) with \(\hat{a}\), this changes the domain to be the character space of \(B=C^{*}(1,a)\) then \(\psi^{-1}\) takes \(f\circ\hat{a}\in C(\Omega(B))\) and maps it to \(B\subset A\). So altogether we get a map from continuous functions on the character space of \(B\) into \(A\).
5. _Evaluation of the identity map on the character space spectra(a)_ 
    Now we consider the evaluation \(\varphi(z)=\psi^{-1}(\hat{a}^t(z))=\psi^{-1}(z(\hat{a}))=\psi^{-1}(\hat{a})=a\)
    [Obviously] \(\varphi\) is [[unital]].
6. _Check that phi is unital_
    \(\varphi(1)=\psi^{-1}(1\circ\hat{a})=\psi^{-1}(1)\) 
    Now since \(\psi\) which is the [[Gelfand representation]] is a \( * \)-isomorphism, then the inverse is, and it must be unital.
7. _Invoke Stone-Weierstrass Theorem_
    By the [[Stone-Weierstrass]] theorem, we know that \(C(\sigma(a))\) is generated by \(1\) and \(z\). This required the spectrum of \(a\) to be compact. We had to prove that the image of \(\varphi\) was indeed the \(C^{*}\)-algebra generated by \(1\) and \(a\)
8. _Reflect_
    We constructed an injective \( * \)-homomorphism from the continuous functions on \(\sigma(a)\) to the \(C^{*}\)-algebra \(A\) which contained \(a\).
    We showed that it mapped the unity to the unity, and the generator \(z\) to \(a\). By [[Stone-Weierstrass]] we have that the image of this map must be the \(C^{*}\)-algebra generated by \(1\) and \(a\). 

    The uniqueness is strange though, will require more pondering
\(\mathcal{QED}\)

<h1 id="2113-theorem-continuous-functional-calculus">2.1.13 Theorem (Continuous functional calculus)</h1>
<p>Let $a$ be a [[normal element]] in a [[unital]] [[C-star-Algebra]] $A$ , suppose that $z:\sigma(a)\hookrightarrow\mathbb{C}$ is the natural inclusion map of the [[spectrum]] of $a$ into the complex plane. Then there exists a unique unital $<em>$-homomorphism $\varphi:C(\sigma(a))\to A$ such that $\varphi(z)=a$
More is true; $\varphi$ is an isometric and $im(\varphi)$ is the $C^{</em>}$-algebra generated by $1$ and $a$.</p>
<p><em>Proof:</em></p>
<ol>
<li><p><em>Invoke the Gelfand representation</em>.
 Denote by $B$ the abelian $C^{*}$-algebra generated by $1$ and $a$
 Let   $\psi:B\to C(\Omega(B))$ be the Gelfand representation.
  (See [[2.1.10 Theorem (Gelfand)]])</p>
</li>
<li><p><em>Properties of the Gelfand representation</em> 
 By [[2.1.10 Theorem (Gelfand)]] $\psi$ is a $*$-isomorphism.</p>
</li>
<li><p><em>Transpose map</em> 
 Since the map $\hat{a}:\Omega(B)\to\sigma(a)$ is a [[homeomorphism]], we know that the transpose mapping induced by precomposing with  $\hat{a}$ , namely $\hat{a}^{t}:C(\Omega(B))\to C(\sigma(a))$ is a $*$-isomorphism.</p>
</li>
<li><p><em>Define the mapping from continuous functions on spectra to A</em>
 Let $\varphi: C(\sigma(a))\to A$ be defined as the composition 
 $\psi^{-1}\hat{a}^{t}(f)=\psi^{-1}(f\circ\hat{a})=\psi^{-1}(f\circ\hat{a})$
  So it takes a continuous function $f$ on the spectrum of $a$, it precomposes $f$ with $\hat{a}$, this changes the domain to be the character space of $B=C^{*}(1,a)$ then $\psi^{-1}$ takes $f\circ\hat{a}\in C(\Omega(B))$ and maps it to $B\subset A$. So altogether we get a map from continuous functions on the character space of $B$ into $A$.</p>
</li>
<li><p><em>Evaluation of the identity map on the character space spectra(a)</em>
 Now we consider the evaluation $\varphi(z)=\psi^{-1}(\hat{a}^t(z))=\psi^{-1}(z(\hat{a}))=\psi^{-1}(\hat{a})=a$
 [Obviously] $\varphi$ is [[unital]].</p>
</li>
<li><p><em>Check that phi is unital</em>
 $\varphi(1)=\psi^{-1}(1\circ\hat{a})=\psi^{-1}(1)$ 
 Now since $\psi$ which is the [[Gelfand representation]] is a $*$-isomorphism, then the inverse is, and it must be unital.</p>
</li>
<li><p><em>Invoke Stone-Weierstrass Theorem</em>
 By the [[Stone-Weierstrass]] theorem, we know that $C(\sigma(a))$ is generated by $1$ and $z$. This required the spectrum of $a$ to be compact. We had to prove that the image of $\varphi$ was indeed the $C^{*}$-algebra generated by $1$ and $a$</p>
</li>
<li><p><em>Reflect</em>
 We constructed an injective $<em>$-homomorphism from the continuous functions on $\sigma(a)$ to the $C^{</em>}$-algebra $A$ which contained $a$.
 We showed that it mapped the unity to the unity, and the generator $z$ to $a$. By [[Stone-Weierstrass]] we have that the image of this map must be the $C^{*}$-algebra generated by $1$ and $a$. </p>
<p> The uniqueness is strange though, will require more pondering</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>$\mathcal{QED}$</p>

  <!-- Mathematical Statement -->
  <p>Let \(a\) be a <span class="math">[[normal element]]</span> in a <span class="math">[[unital]] [[C-star-Algebra]] \(A\)</span>, suppose that \(z:\sigma(a)\hookrightarrow\mathbb{C}\) is the natural inclusion map of the <span class="math">[[spectrum]]</span> of \(a\) into the complex plane. Then there exists a unique unital <span class="math">\( * \)</span>-homomorphism \(\varphi:C(\sigma(a))\to A\) such that \(\varphi(z)=a\). More is true; \(\varphi\) is an isometric and \(im(\varphi)\) is the \(C^{*}\)-algebra generated by \(1\) and \(a\).</p>

  <!-- Proof -->
  <ol>
    <li><em>Invoke the Gelfand representation</em>. Denote by \(B\) the abelian \(C^{*}\)-algebra generated by \(1\) and \(a\). Let \(\psi:B\to C(\Omega(B))\) be the Gelfand representation. (See <span class="math">[[2.1.10 Theorem (Gelfand)]]</span>)</li>
    <li><em>Properties of the Gelfand representation</em>. By <span class="math">[[2.1.10 Theorem (Gelfand)]]</span>, \(\psi\) is a \( * \)-isomorphism.</li>
    <li><em>Transpose map</em>. Since the map \(\hat{a}:\Omega(B)\to\sigma(a)\) is a <span class="math">[[homeomorphism]]</span>, we know that the transpose mapping induced by precomposing with \(\hat{a}\), namely \(\hat{a}^{t}:C(\Omega(B))\to C(\sigma(a))\), is a \( * \)-isomorphism.</li>
    <li><em>Define the mapping from continuous functions on spectra to \(A\)</em>. Let \(\varphi: C(\sigma(a))\to A\) be defined as the composition \(\psi^{-1}\hat{a}^{t}(f)=\psi^{-1}(f\circ\hat{a})=\psi^{-1}(f\circ\hat{a})\). So it takes a continuous function \(f\) on the spectrum of \(a\), it precomposes \(f\) with \(\hat{a}\), this changes the domain to be the character space of \(B=C^{*}(1,a)\), then \(\psi^{-1}\) takes \(f\circ\hat{a}\in C(\Omega(B))\) and maps it to \(B\subset A\). So altogether we get a map from continuous functions on the character space of \(B\) into \(A\).</li>
    <li><em>Evaluation of the identity map on the character space spectra(a)</em>. Now we consider the evaluation \(\varphi(z)=\psi^{-1}(\hat{a}^t(z))=\psi^{-1}(z(\hat{a}))=\psi^{-1}(\hat{a})=a\) [Obviously] \(\varphi\) is <span class="math">[[unital]]</span>.</li>
    <li><em>Check that \(\varphi\) is unital</em>. \(\varphi(1)=\psi^{-1}(1\circ\hat{a})=\psi^{-1}(1)\). Now since \(\psi\), which is the <span class="math">[[Gelfand representation]]</span>, is a \( * \)-isomorphism, then the inverse is, and it must be unital.</li>
    <li><em>Invoke Stone-Weierstrass Theorem</

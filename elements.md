<h2 id="content">Background</h2>
<p>I was born in Medellin, Colombia, and later immigrated to the United States in 2014. After settling here in the United States, I pursued a dual major in Pure Mathematics and Economics at the University of South Florida. Under the mentorship of Dr. Thomas Bieske, I completed my undergraduate studies in 2022. Currently, I am continuing my academic journey at Purdue University, where I am part of the mathematics department. Under the guidance of Dr. Andrew Toms, my research centers around the interplay between induced measures and tracial states. Specifically, I explore these concepts within the context of self-adjoint elements in a \(\mathcal{Z}\)-stable \(C^∗\)-algebra. Additionally, I investigate the fine structures that the Cuntz semigroup retains from a given \(C^∗\)-algebra.
